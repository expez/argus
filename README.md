# argus

The publics demand for being watched is insatiable.  In a time where entertainment options are plenty, people are forced to be increasingly outrageous in order to attract attention to themselves.  Even though modern surveillance is widespread, a single watcher is often responsible for watching several people.  Needless to say, this doesn't afford the level of attention that the watchees deserve and demand.

The argus project's ultimate goal is to restore the 1-1 releationship between watcher and watchee, while simultaneously solving the recursive problem of 'who's watching the watchers'.
